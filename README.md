# ProbSol-with-Algor-dataStr-Using-Py

**'Problem Solving with Algorithm and Data Structures Using Python'** written by Brad Miller and David Ranum, Luther College, is a freely available online-version interactive textbook.

This book is very helpful for beginners (like me) to understand algorithm and data structure especially based on python. 
It does not cover many examples like other algorithm books, but all cases explained in this book are well-known and widely used basically.
And the detailed explanations of all steps allow me to quickly catch on.

I took notes of some of the cases.
